## Install

#### Downloading Latest Releases

The latest release of TameGenus can be downloaded from 
[here](https://github.com/thetensor-space/TameGenus/releases/latest) 
as either a `tar.gz` or `zip` file.

#### Linux and Mac users

We will assume your directory for Magma packages is titled `my_magma_packages`. You can create this directory with
```
$ mkdir my_magma_packages
```
Download `TameGenus-x.y.tar.gz` file from the latest release into `my_magma_package`.
Then you could run the following to unzip TameGenus and install the package.
```
$ cd my_magma_packages
$ gzip TameGenus-x.y.zip
$ sh TameGenus/install.sh
```

This may install further packages necessary in `my_magma_packages`. It may also modify your Magma start file (`~/.magmarc`) so that these packages are available at the start of a Magma session. To avoid this, use the manual installation instructions below.


#### Manually

Currently, we do not have an install file compatible with Windows. 

This package requires three other packages publicly available on GitHub.
  1. [TensorSpace](https://github.com/thetensor-space/TensorSpace)
  2. [StarAlge](https://github.com/thetensor-space/StarAlge)
  3. [Sylver](https://github.com/thetensor-space/Sylver)

Check the README files to install each of the required packages.

Attach the spec file during a Magma run and the intrinsics will be available
to use.  To attach the spec file, run the following, where `<location>` is the directory containing TameGenus,
```
> AttachSpec("<location>/TameGenus/TameGenus.spec");
```



## Uninstall

This package can be removed entirely by deleting the folder into which it was 
downloaded and removing the following lines from your `~/.magmarc` file.
```
AttachSpec("<location>/TameGenus/TameGenus.spec");
```

To remove the dependencies, delete the folders for TensorSpace, StarAlge, and 
Sylver along with the following lines from your `~/.magmarc` file.
```
AttachSpec("<location>/TensorSpace/TensorSpace.spec");
AttachSpec("<location>/StarAlge/StarAlge.spec");
AttachSpec("<location>/Sylver/Sylver.spec");
```



## Feedback and Bugs

We welcome general feedback about the package and challenging examples. To report bugs, please create a [New Issue](https://github.com/thetensor-space/TameGenus/issues/new) under the [Issues](https://github.com/thetensor-space/TameGenus/issues) tab in the TameGenus repository, or @-mention any of the above contributors in your forked repository.
